## Introduction
House price prediction is a common problem in the real estate industry and can benefit both buyers and sellers by providing estimates of property values. This project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices based on relevant features.

## Features
The model considers the following features for predicting houe prices:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- GRadient Boosting Algorithms (e.g. XGBoost, LightGMB)

## Model Training
The selected model is trained using the preprocessed data. The training process involves fitting the model to the training dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between features and house prices.

## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using a separate testing dataset to assess its performance. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated to measure the model's accuracy.

## Deployment
Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for making predictions on new data. Deployment may involve integrating the model into web applications, APIs, or other systems where it will be used.

## Usage
To use the trained model for predicting house prices:
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Load the trained model.
3. Provde input features (e.g., location, zise, amenities).
Get the predicted house price from the model.
